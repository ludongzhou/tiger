2.1 Write regular expressions for each of the following.
    a. Strings over the alphabet {a, b, c} where the first a precedes the first b.
        [a|c][a|b|c]*
    b. Strings over the alphabet {a, b, c} with an even number of a’s.
        [[b|c]*[a[b|c]*a]?]*
    c. Binary numbers that are multiples of four.
        [1|0]*00
    d. Binary numbers that are greater than 101001.

    e. Strings over the alphabet {a, b, c} that don’t contain the contiguous substring baa.
        [[a|c]|[bc|b+c|b+a[b|c]]]*
    f. The language of nonnegative integer constants in C, where numbers
       beginning with 0 are octal constants and other numbers are decimal constants.
        [0[0-7]*|[0-9]*]
    g. Binary numbers n such that there exists an integer solution of a^n + b^n = c^n.
        [1|0]+

2.2 For each of the following, explain why you’re not surprised that there is no regular expression defining it.
    a. Strings of a’s and b’s where there are more a’s than b’s.
    b. Strings of a’s and b’s that are palindromes (the same forward as backward). c. Syntactically correct C programs.
